# Suss Soundboard
A player soundboard module for Foundry VTT

**Suss Soundboard** is a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module that allows players to play sounds. Out of the box, only a GM can play sounds and music through Foundry VTT. This module creates a playlist for each player and grants them permission to play sounds in that playlist.

I hope that this module brings just a little more fun to your virtual table.

## Compatibility
**IMPORTANT:** Suss Soundboard has only been tested with Foundry VTT v11.315. If you try this module with another version, I would love to know whether it worked for you!
